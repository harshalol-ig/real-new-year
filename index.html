                Shivani,<br><br>
                As this new year begins, I didn’t want to keep this hidden anymore.<br><br>
                I really like you.<br>
                Its been for a while...,It took me a lot of courage to confess it,and I really just want to let you know...<br><br>
                no matter what decision you take I respect that, just dont put me in the creeps list lol<br>
                No pressure,No expectations I dont want to take much of ur time,and maybe today ill delete instagram cause my stupid exams,
                I am sorry if I broke ur trust,have a beautiful year ahead :)
