                Shivani,<br><br>
                As this new year begins, I didn’t want to keep this hidden anymore.<br><br>
                I really like you.<br>
                You have a way of making things feel lighter, just by being you.<br><br>
                No pressure. No expectations. just don't put me in the creeps list lol.and maybe today will be my last day cause got my exams in a month wont be online for a while<br>
                Just honesty — and a wish for a beautiful year ahead 💖
